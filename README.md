# Daily DSA Practice

This repository is dedicated to the consistent practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving one problem each day from platforms like HackerRank and CodeWars. The problems span a wide range of topics. This daily practice is perfect for enhancing problem-solving skills, preparing for technical interviews and solidifying understanding of essential computer science principles. Each week's practice solutions are stored in separate branches corresponding to the week number. You can switch branches to view solutions and follow along with the daily practice.
