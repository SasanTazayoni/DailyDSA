# Daily DSA Practice

This repository is dedicated to the daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through solving problems from platforms like HackerRank and CodeWars. The problems cover a wide range of topics, making this practice ideal for enhancing problem-solving skills, preparing for technical interviews, and solidifying essential computer science concepts.

Each week's problems, along with their respective platforms, are documented in a specific markdown file. Solutions for each week's problems are stored in corresponding JavaScript files. You can follow along with the daily practice by accessing the respective files for each week.
